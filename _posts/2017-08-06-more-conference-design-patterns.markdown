After posting my [favorite conference design patterns](/2017/07/29/conference-design-patterns.html)
last week, a few friends had some great replies on Twitter with their own
favorites. I want to highlight them as I pretty much fully agree with these
and think they definitely belong on a favorites list.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Co-locating related events, such as pre-conference meetups, or other conferences with cross appeal, is a clever thing some conferences do</p>&mdash; Erik Erlandson (@manyangled) <a href="https://twitter.com/manyangled/status/891298981745049600">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

This is a fantastic call by Erik. One of the things I absolutely love
to do at technology conferences is participate in interactive sessions. These
are often developer, operator and user forums where the communtities
are seeking to learn about the road maps for the projects they use. I look
forward to these sessions because I have such a great time hearing about ideas
that come from the across community and I am grateful for the chance to
experience such a broad cross-section of thought. 

Having a community meetup at the same place as a conference about the related
technology is a perfect venue for this type of activity. Your community will
get to meet each other and participate in some live development which is a
tremendous team building opportunity. On a personal note, I also find it fun
just to meet people that I otherwise only know through a chat nickname or from
video calls.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">I like speaker lounges, as a space for last-minute deck hacking and especially if they&#39;re set up to pre-test A/V connectivity</p>&mdash; Erik Erlandson (@manyangled) <a href="https://twitter.com/manyangled/status/891297085026217985">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

While this doesn't target everyone, if you've ever been a speaker at a
conference or are considering it this is a point to remember. It can be pretty
nerve-wracking in the hours leading up to your presentation. One of the
things that can really help to quell the nerves and keep you focused on your
performance is to practice your routine and make sure that everything on
your display device is in working order. For the conference organizers, having
a duplicate display configuration in a speaker's lounge will also help
alleviate technical issues beforehand. It's a tough choice to make as it does
require more resources to setup and maintain, but a choice worth considering.

<blockquote class="twitter-tweet tw-align-center" data-conversation="none" data-lang="en"><p lang="en" dir="ltr">Open spaces is a nice pattern too</p>&mdash; XXX (@hguemar) <a href="https://twitter.com/hguemar/status/891295375671386112">July 29, 2017</a></blockquote>

Finally, I really appreciate this idea from Haikel. Depending on the venue a
conference can get quite stuffy and even when that is not the case we all need
space to decompress and relax. It is a great luxury for a conference venue to
have large open spaces where attendees can avail themselves of the area and
ambience. I really appreciate having the chance to talk quietly with
colleagues or study some notes from a session, perhaps while enjoying a tea or
coffee.

I can only imagine that choosing a venue is not an easy task for conference
organizers, so this design pattern is a big ask in my opinion. But still, it
is fantastic when a conference venue can offer some nice spaces for
contemplative activities, even in the midst of the air of business and
progress that fuels the industry which calls us.
