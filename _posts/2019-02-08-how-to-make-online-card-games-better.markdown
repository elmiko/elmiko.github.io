I've been a fan of card games for many years. Not so much in the
[Poker](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Poker) or
[Twenty-One](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Blackjack) direction, but more in
the [Magic: the Gathering](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering)
or [Dominion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dominion_(card_game)) direction.
And while I've always found
[Magic: the Gathering Online](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magic:_The_Gathering_Online)
to be an interesting
idea, the client that was released never really captured the PC gamer in me.
When games like [Hearthstone](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearthstone)
started to come out I got really excited again as I felt game makers were
concentrating on how to turn these types of card games into great PC games
as well.

## What went wrong?

I give a lot of credit to the game developers out there, I think there has
been a great deal of innovation and care put into the user experience on most
of the card games that have come out over the last few years. There is a great
evenness of experience where things mostly work the way I expect and it
becomes easier to lern new games and mechanics because of this. Additionally,
the visual and audio art for most of these games is deliciously appealing.
But I do feel there is something lacking that would take these games to the
next level.

When I first started playing _Magic: the Gathering_ the biggest draw for me by
far was the social aspect of the game. My friends would gather and we would
talk about the cards, make decks, swap ideas, and play many games all while
keeping the spirit and mood of the event lively and positive. Sure, there
were times when people got competitive and would be upset when things didn't
go their way, but this was all in good nature.

As I have been playing these new online games, and have been getting back into
_Magic_ through their [Arena game](https://magic.wizards.com/en/mtgarena)
after at least a 20 year hiatus, one thing that
I have found most lacking is the social aspect. The entire game is now reduced
to a series of cool, clean mechanics where I am queued up to face the next
opponent. The interaction is crafted to be an experience of pure gameplay with
minimal social interaction, which I can understand given the nature of many
online communities! But all of this really kills the fun and experience of the
game for me, and I find myself turned away as both a player and a potential
customer of some great game developers.

## How to make it right.

Bring the community back into the game.

I've played enough online games to know that these game developers have all
the resources ready and canned to create awesome online communities in their
games. Why not bring these technologies to the world of card games?

Here are my prescriptions:

* Introduce guild-like community structures. Allow players to create the same
  type of organizations that they use in other online games. Give them access
  to tools that enable community management and curation. Guilds would become
  a natural space for players to find others with similar attitudes and
  interests to play against.

* Enhance the social communication technology for friendly players.
  Voice chat is becoming a near commodity level technology in many games these
  days. Once players have identified a friendly relationship, either through
  friends list or guild status, allow those players to create voice channels
  and have easy access to private rooms when playing games against each other.
  Allow extended friends to spectate on other games and even join chat rooms
  when invited.

* Give communities access to more game modes. If two, or more, players know
  each other and are established friends then why not let them control things
  like turn timers? This seems like a basic convenience to players. Giving
  them the ability to intentionally make games more casual, or even more
  competitive, gives players more power to enjoy the game. Even further, I think
  it would be great to allow communities to organize tournament play through
  the game client. This is a deep topic and I could go on at length, but the
  short story is give the players access to basic game mode controls.

## I'm hopeful for the future.

I really hope the big game developers will start to pay more attention to the
social aspect of their games. But even if they don't, I am hopeful that the
smaller game developers are looking at this and will bring it back into the
games they are making. I really feel like we are due for a resergence of the
social-inspired themes that helped turn the original
[MUDs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MUD) into games like
[Everquest](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/EverQuest) and
[Dark Age of Camelot](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dark_Age_of_Camelot) which
were fan favorites for the strength of community around them. The same could
happen for card games, and I hope it does.
