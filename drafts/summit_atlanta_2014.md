The Atlanta 2014 summit was my first time attending an OpenStack gathering and
I absolutely loved it. The amount of learning and communication that occurred
was fantastic. Although I was exhausted at the end of every day it usually
took me quite a while to fall asleep as my mind was turning over all the
interesting things I had learned during the day.

The summit was more than just a great opportunity to learn though, I also had
the pleasure of meeting several team members as well as a host of wonderful
people I had communicated with only through irc and email. The design sessions
were a great time to confer with fellow developers and users, and I felt a
spirit of cooperation that permeating the event.

Aside from participating in the Sahra related events I was also keenly
interested in learning more about Neutron and OpenStack networking in general.
By Tuesday evening I felt that I had been drinking from the Neutron firehose
as there were several excellent talks. I was also pleasantly surprised to
find several talks on containerization
